        <h2>What is Ideal Weight?</h2>
<p>Ideal weight refers to the weight range that is considered optimal for an individual's height, age, gender, body composition, and overall health. It is often used as a guideline to assess whether a person's weight is within a healthy range.</p>
<h3>How is Ideal Weight Determined?</h3>
<p>Ideal weight can be determined using various methods, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Body Mass Index (BMI): BMI is a calculation based on height and weight that categorizes individuals into underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.</li>
    <li>Body Composition Analysis: This method assesses the proportion of body fat, muscle, bone, and other tissues to determine a healthy weight range.</li>
    <li>Health Assessment: Ideal weight may also be determined based on factors such as age, gender, medical history, and overall health status.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Importance of Ideal Weight:</h3>
<p>Maintaining an ideal weight is important for overall health and well-being. It can help reduce the risk of various health conditions, including obesity-related diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.</p>
<h3>Factors Affecting Ideal Weight:</h3>
<p>Several factors influence an individual's ideal weight, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Height: Taller individuals typically have higher ideal weight ranges.</li>
    <li>Body Composition: Body fat percentage and muscle mass play a significant role in determining ideal weight.</li>
    <li>Age: Ideal weight may change with age due to changes in metabolism, hormone levels, and body composition.</li>
    <li>Gender: Ideal weight ranges may differ between males and females due to differences in body composition and fat distribution.</li>
    <li>Health Conditions: Certain medical conditions may affect ideal weight and require individualized assessment and management.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to Achieve and Maintain Ideal Weight:</h3>
